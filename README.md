Task 3 - Payment Gateway Integration

Flow of the website:-

1.Creating a simple website where the payment gateway is integrated.

2.There will be a simple donate button on homepage. On clicking the donate button, the user will land on the payment page where user can select the amount to be paid and the payment type, e.g. credit card, Paypal, etc.

3.Once the payment is done an invoice will be generated and a mail will be sent to the user for the payment received. The invoice will contain the amount. 

4.On any page / email, only basic information is needed. 

5.Creating my own temporary / sandbox / testing accounts with 3rd party for integrations. 

6.Hosting the website at 000webhost, github.io, heroku app or any other free hosting provider. Checking in code in gitlab.
